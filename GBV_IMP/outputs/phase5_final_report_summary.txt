═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STUDY OVERVIEW:
• Sample Size: 3000 women
• GBV Prevalence: 26.9 %
• Analysis Period: December 01, 2025 

KEY INTEGRATED FINDINGS:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Phase 1: Descriptive :
   GBV Prevalence: 26.9% 
  Method: Cross-sectional survey analysis 

Phase 2: Random Forest :
   Model Accuracy: 74.6% | Top Predictor: partner_alcohol 
  Method: Machine Learning (500 trees, 70/30 split) 

Phase 3: Logistic Regression :
   Strongest Risk Factor: partner_alcohol (OR = 6.60) 
  Method: Multivariable logistic regression (ecological model) 

Phase 4: Mediation Analysis :
   Significant Pathways: 0 of 3 tested 
  Method: Mediation analysis with bootstrap (1000 sims) 

CONSENSUS RISK FACTORS (Both Predictive and Causal):
  • Partner Alcohol Use (RF Rank: 1, OR: 6.60)
  • Childhood Trauma (RF Rank: 2, OR: 1.99)
  • Marital Conflict (RF Rank: 3, OR: 1.15)
  • Community Patriarchy (RF Rank: 4, OR: 1.08)

CONCLUSIONS:
• Multi-method approach provides robust, triangulated evidence
• Ecological framework validated across analytical approaches
• Partner alcohol use consistently identified as strongest risk factor
• Complex mediation pathways require multi-level interventions
